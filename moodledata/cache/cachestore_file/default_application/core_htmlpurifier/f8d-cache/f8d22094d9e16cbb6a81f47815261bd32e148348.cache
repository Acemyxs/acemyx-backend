nobody* else can see this post.</p>

<p><em>On a course blog:</em> <strong>Visible to participants on this course</strong> – to view the post you must
have been granted access to the blog, usually by being enrolled on the course that contains it.</p>

<p><strong>Visible to everyone who is logged in to the system</strong> – everyone who is
logged in can view the post, even if they're not enrolled on a specific course.</p>

<p><strong>Visible to anyone in the world</strong> – any Internet user can see this post
if you give them the blog's address.</p>

<p>This option exists on the whole blog as well as on individual posts. If the
option is set on the whole blog, that becomes a maximum. For example, if
the whole blog is set to the first level, you cannot change the
level of an individual post at all.</p>
