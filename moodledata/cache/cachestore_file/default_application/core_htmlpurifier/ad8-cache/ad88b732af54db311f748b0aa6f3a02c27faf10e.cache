s:1215:"<p>Great! You're right that matrices can be used to handle multiple variables in a system of linear equations. Let's break down the process step by step.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Formulating the System as Matrices</strong>:
Suppose you have a system of linear equations like this:</p>

<p>[
\begin{cases}
ax + by = e \
cx + dy = f
\end{cases}
]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing in Matrix Form</strong>:</p>

<p>This can be written in matrix form as (AX = B), where:</p>

<ul>
<li>(A) is the coefficient matrix,</li>
<li>(X) is the column vector of variables,</li>
<li>and (B) is the column vector of constants.</li>
</ul>

<p>For our example, it would look like:</p>

<p>[
 A = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp; b\
  c &amp; d
 \end{pmatrix},
 X =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  x\
  y
 \end{pmatrix},
 B =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  e\
  f
 \end{pmatrix}.
\]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solving for X</strong>:</p>

<p>To find (X), we need to solve for it using matrix operations. One common method involves finding the inverse of matrix A (if it exists). The solution can be expressed as:</p>

<p>\
X = A^{-1}B.
\</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far, does everything make sense? Do you have any questions about these steps before we proceed further?</p>
