s:1018:"<p>Dear Students,</p> 
<p>Weâ€™ve made some improvements to the <strong>Mathematics Mock Exam</strong> to ensure it aligns better with the WAEC standard! ðŸš€ However, in order to apply these changes, we had to <strong>delete the previous mock exam</strong>. As a result, <strong>all previous attempts and user data for that exam have been removed</strong>.</p> 
<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Whatâ€™s New?</strong><br />âœ… <strong>50 WAEC-standard questions</strong><br />âœ… <strong>40-minute time limit</strong><br />âœ… <strong>More structured and refined for better practice</strong></p> 
<p>We understand this may be inconvenient for those who had already attempted the previous exam, but this change was necessary to provide a better learning experience. You can now take the <strong>new and improved Mathematics Mock Exam</strong> and continue your preparation with enhanced accuracy!</p> 
<p>Thank you for your understanding and commitment to excellence! If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out. ðŸ’¡ðŸ“š</p> ";
