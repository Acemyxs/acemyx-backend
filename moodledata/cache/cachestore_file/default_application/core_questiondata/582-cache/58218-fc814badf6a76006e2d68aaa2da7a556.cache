This practice has severe environmental consequences. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down, the carbon stored in them is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Deforestation also leads to habitat loss for many species, threatening biodiversity. Moreover, it disrupts the water cycle, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and increasing the risk of floods and droughts. Efforts to combat deforestation include reforestation, the planting of trees in deforested areas, and promoting sustainable land use practices.";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"0";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"0";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0.3333333;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125102447+Eqis0k";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1732530287";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1732530287";s:9:"createdby";s:1:"2";s:10:"modifiedby";s:1:"2";s:8:"idnumber";N;s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:6:"status";s:5:"ready";s:9:"versionid";s:5:"58218";s:7:"version";s:1:"1";s:19:"questionbankentryid";s:5:"58213";s:14:"categoryobject";O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:2:"id";s:4:"4354";s:4:"name";s:19:"expostion-passage-2";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:4:"info";s:0:"";s:10:"infoformat";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125102447+ELCMMW";s:6:"parent";s:4:"2317";s:9:"sortorder";s:3:"999";s:8:"idnumber";N;}s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
