Advocates argue that EVs produce zero emissions during operation, reducing air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, technological advancements have led to improvements in battery life and charging infrastructure, making EVs more practical and convenient. However, critics point out that the production of EV batteries involves significant environmental impact due to mining activities and energy-intensive manufacturing processes. They also argue that the electricity used to charge EVs often comes from non-renewable sources, which undermines their environmental benefits. To fully realize the potential of EVs, it is essential to address these challenges and transition to cleaner energy sources for electricity generation.";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"0";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"0";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0.3333333;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125093653+O5OsnP";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1732527413";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1732527413";s:9:"createdby";s:1:"2";s:10:"modifiedby";s:1:"2";s:8:"idnumber";N;s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:6:"status";s:5:"ready";s:9:"versionid";s:5:"57996";s:7:"version";s:1:"1";s:19:"questionbankentryid";s:5:"57991";s:14:"categoryobject";O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:2:"id";s:4:"4336";s:4:"name";s:42:"argumentation persuation passage-passage-4";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:4:"info";s:0:"";s:10:"infoformat";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125093653+JQeEgr";s:6:"parent";s:4:"2317";s:9:"sortorder";s:3:"999";s:8:"idnumber";N;}s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
