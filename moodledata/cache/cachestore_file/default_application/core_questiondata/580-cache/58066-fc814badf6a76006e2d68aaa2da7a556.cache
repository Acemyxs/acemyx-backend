Advocates argue that telecommuting offers employees greater flexibility and can lead to increased job satisfaction and productivity. They claim that working from home eliminates the stress and time associated with commuting, allowing employees to focus better on their tasks. Additionally, telecommuting can reduce overhead costs for employers and contribute to environmental sustainability by decreasing the number of cars on the road. However, critics contend that telecommuting can blur the boundaries between work and personal life, leading to longer working hours and increased stress. They also argue that the lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder collaboration and innovation. Balancing these perspectives is crucial for organizations considering telecommuting as a viable work arrangement.";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"0";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"0";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0.3333333;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125102048+FDTqBY";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1732530048";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1732530048";s:9:"createdby";s:1:"2";s:10:"modifiedby";s:1:"2";s:8:"idnumber";N;s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:6:"status";s:5:"ready";s:9:"versionid";s:5:"58066";s:7:"version";s:1:"1";s:19:"questionbankentryid";s:5:"58061";s:14:"categoryobject";O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:2:"id";s:4:"4342";s:4:"name";s:43:"argumentation persuation passage-passage-10";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2278";s:4:"info";s:0:"";s:10:"infoformat";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:38:"academy.acemyx.com+241125102048+Ksp8r7";s:6:"parent";s:4:"2317";s:9:"sortorder";s:3:"999";s:8:"idnumber";N;}s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
